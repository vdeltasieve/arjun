# A Relative Journey Uff Numbers
Let n = p × q (p < q) and ∆ = |p − q|, where p, q are odd integers, then, it is hypothesized that factorizing this composite n will take O(1) time once the steady state value is reached for any ∆ in zone0 of some observation deck (od) with speciﬁc dial settings. We also introduce a new factorization approach by looking for ∆ in different ∆ sieve zones. Once ∆ is found and n is already given, one can easily ﬁnd the factors of this composite n from any one of the following quadratic equations: p2 + p∆− n = 0 or q2 − q∆− n = 0. The new factorization approach does not rely on congruence of squares or any special properties of n, p or q and is only based on sieving the ∆. In addition, some other new factorization approaches are also discussed. Finally, a new trapdoor function is presented which is leveraged to encrypt and decrypt a message with different keys.
